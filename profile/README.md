# Smart Low-Cost Warehouse Management System

This organization will contain all the progress on the development of a WMS that use the least of physical infrastructure, with the idea of being an starting WMS with the "complete" experience of one, but reducing the cost whenever its possible. In this mindset, this WMS should be perfect for micro operations, but its part of our ideals to make it scalate even for bigger ones. By the time, the architecture of microservices is completely designed, and available for contributions on the [Architecture Repo](https://github.com/SLC-wms/DSL-Architecture), or take this [shortcut](https://slc-wms.github.io/DSL-Architecture/main/) to the architecture diagram's compiled.

Want to start the development of a microservice by your own? Visit our microservice templates on [TypeScript](https://github.com/SLC-wms/TS-Service-Template) and [Python](https://github.com/SLC-wms/PY-Service-Template), but first, make sure to take look in our rules, so you can make your contributions match our standards and be accepted quicker. Those rules are concentrated in our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/SLC-wms/.github/tree/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), so go on and read them if you haven't already. To have more context of what is going on, you can also visit our [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/SLC-wms/discussions), join our Slack server, or just visit the [project](https://github.com/orgs/SLC-wms/projects/1).

Now, you can take a look on these portrait views that fulfills part of the system, so everything can come together easily. If there is any questions about these wireframes, don't hesitate on opening a discussion topic, or reach out on the Slack server if you want!
