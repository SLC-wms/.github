# Our vision

The SLC-wms serves as an organization to have all the related repos in one place, so SLC-wms is a PROJECT, not a company. However that can change in the future as the project grows, but until then, everything will be licensed in a Copyleft fashion. Why Open Source? This project started as a side project of the current founder [@Vicente-G](https://github.com/Vicente-G), and with no more people in the team, it seemed like the right move to open the project, so other talented people can help in making this big.

Also, the construction of this WMS, has a target on smaller operations, so it just make sense for this development to be free of charge, and let people just pay for what they use with a cloud provider. So, that's why this project started, it is a nice oportunity of learning for the founder and any contributor that joined in, and has for objective to bring the technology associated with logistics closer to those entrepreneur souls worldwide.
